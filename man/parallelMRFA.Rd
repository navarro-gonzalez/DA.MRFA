\title{
Parallel Analysis using Minimum Rank Factor Analysis (MRFA)
}
\description{
Performs Parallel Analysis using Minimum Rank Factor Analysis (MRFA).
}
\usage{
parallelMRFA(X, Ndatsets = 500, percent = 95, corr= "Pearson", display = TRUE,
    graph = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
Raw sample scores.
}
  \item{Ndatsets}{
Number of random datasets used to compute the random distribution of eigenvalues.
}
  \item{percent}{
Desired percentile of distribution of random eigenvalues (for example 95 for the 95th percentile) to be used as threshold.
}
  \item{corr}{
Determine if Pearson or Polychoric matrix will be used "Pearson": Computes Pearson correlation matrices "Polychoric": Computes Polychoric/Tetrachoric correlation matrices (heavy time consuming).
}
  \item{display}{
Determines if the output will be displayed in the console, TRUE by default. If it is TRUE, the output is returned silently and if it is FALSE, the output is returned in the console.
}
  \item{graph}{
Request that a plot representing the percentage of explained variance by the real data, by the mean of the random data and using the percentile of distribution of random eigenvalues, defined in the percent argument.
}
}
\details{
\code{parallelMRFA} is based on the procedure proposed by Timmerman and Lorenzo-Seva (2011) which is designed for assessing the dimensionality of a variable set. The principal advantage of using MRFA (Ten Berge & Kiers, 1991) instead the usual PCA extraction process is that the eigenvalues obtained from MRFA can be used to estimate the explained common variance per factor.

The eigenvalue sampling distribution is obtaining using a nonparametric approach: a permutation of the raw data (Buja & Eyuboglu, 1992). This approach is recommended for PA especially in cases where the observed data ditribution clearly deviates from normality.

If the matrix to analyze is not positive-defined, a smoothering procedure will be applied (Devlin, Gnanadesikan & Kettenring, 1981).

\item{Percentile_random}{A vector containing the percentage of explained variance by the percentile of distribution of random data for each factor}
\item{Number_factors_mean}{The number of factors to be retained suggested comparing the real data with the mean of the random data}
\item{Number_factors_percentiles}{The number of factors to be retained suggested comparing the real data with the percentile of distribution of the random data}
