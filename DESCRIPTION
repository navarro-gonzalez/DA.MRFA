Description: DA.MRFA is designed for perform Parallel Analysis (PA) using Minimum Rank Factor Analysis (MRFA). The computation is based on the procedure proposed by Timmerman and Lorenzo-Seva (2011) which is designed for assessing the dimensionality of a variable set.
    The package also includes the option to compute MRFA by itself, as well as the Greater Lower Bound (glb) calculation.
